- **iostream**: For input and output operations.
- **Shellapi.h**: For Shell API functions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/clipesss/TriggerGTA5RP.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd TriggerGTA5RP
    ```

3. **Build the project:**
    - If you are using a command-line C++ compiler:
        ```sh
        g++ -o TriggerGTA5RP main.cpp -lWindows
        ```
    - If you are using an IDE like Visual Studio, open the solution file (`example.sln`) and build the project using the IDE's build tools.

## Usage

After building the project, run the executable to start the trigger bot. Ensure that GTA 5 RP is running and the bot will automate the predefined actions in the game.

### Running the Bot

1. Launch GTA 5 RP.
2. Run the `exemple.exe` file from the command line or by double-clicking the executable in your file explorer.
